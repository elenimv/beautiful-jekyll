title: About me
---

My name is Eleni Voudouris. I am currently a sophomore studying Computer Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign.

### My story

As a dedicated Computer Science sophomore at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, I bring strong analytical skills, adaptability, and a collaborative mindset that make me a valuable team player. My background in motion planning algorithms, coupled with hands-on research experience in a variety of different fields, has equipped me with a solid foundation for contributing to impactful, interdisciplinary solutions. Currently, I am conducting research in a lab focused on optimizing motion planning algorithms for computational solutions, my current project specifically targeting innovations in areas like protein folding and molecular interactions. This experience has honed my ability to approach complex problems methodically, pivot when necessary, and remain detail-oriented while addressing broader objectives. I am passionate about advancing both new and previously established computational algorithms, and I am eager to bring my knowledge and enthusiasm to the table.
